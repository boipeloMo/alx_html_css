        <p>
            Hello! I'm Boipelo, and this webpage marks an exciting step in my journey into software engineering. I'm currently focused on mastering the fundamentals of web development, starting with HTML, CSS, and eventually JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is to build impactful and user-friendly digital experiences. I believe that a strong foundation in core web technologies is crucial for creating robust and scalable applications in the future.

        <h3>My Learning Focus</h3>
        <p>
            I'm dedicated to continuous learning and am particularly keen on understanding how different web components interact. This portfolio will serve as a living showcase of my progress, from simple static pages to more dynamic and interactive projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm eager to tackle new problems and expand my skillset. I'm excited about the possibilities that web development offers and look forward to contributing to the tech community.
